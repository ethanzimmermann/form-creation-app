# Form Creation

## Description
```
This application allows users to create simple surveys, submit previously created surveys, and view reporting on survey submissions.

Users can create surveys broken into sections and containing radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. This application uses the json-server package to mimic a data service, allowing the app to save surveys and survey submissions, as well as report on previously submitted surveys.
